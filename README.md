# song-popularity-prediction
This is a group project from school where we used a large dataset from spotify to try and predict what made an album popular. All the albums had the same attributes like bpm, key, duartion and a popualarity score.
Through this project we wanted to find out what and how the different attributes affected the popularity score and then put predcition models on them to see if we could predict what made a song popular.
